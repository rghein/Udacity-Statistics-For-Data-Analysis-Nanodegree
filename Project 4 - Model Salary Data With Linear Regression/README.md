## Project Scenario

In this project, you will build a linear model and interpret the results of the model. Specifically, you will look at what variables are related to salaries

## Project Instructions

There are three sections of this project that you will need to complete. Below you will find directions to assist with each portion of this project.
Data Description

In this portion of the presentation, you should describe at least the following aspects of the dataset:

- the number of employees that are in the dataset
- how missing data were handled
- the range of salaries
- any plots or estimates that suggest certain features in the dataset are likely correlated to salary

## Regression Results

In this portion of the presentation, you should

- share the regression output associated with your linear model
- identify which variables are statistically significant in their relationship with salary
- remove variables from the model that are not statistically significant
- identify how well the model fits the data

## Interpretation of Model Results

In this portion of the presentation, you should choose two variables in the model and provide:

- the expected range of change in salary related to changes in this variable
- how confident you are that these changes are likely to happen

Ex: We can be 95% confident that salary will increase between 10 and 20 dollars when moving from no title to a director title. (this example is for illustrative purposes only)
