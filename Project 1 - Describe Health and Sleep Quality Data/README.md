# Project Instructions

There are four sections of this project that you will need to complete. Below you will find directions to assist with each portion of this project.

## Data Description

As you inspect the health and sleep quality dataset, notice there are examples of all the data types you are now familiar with.

On this slide, provide an example of each of the following:

- ____________ is an example of a continuous variable in the dataset.
- ____________ is an example of an integer variable in the dataset.
- ____________ is an example of an ordinal categorical variable in the dataset.
- ____________ is an example of a nominal categorical variable in the dataset.

Notice there are often multiple columns that could fit the category above.

## Typical Amount (Minutes) of Physical Activity

On this slide, provide the mean, median, and mode number of minutes of physical activity in the dataset.

Standout suggestion: What do the relationships between these values suggest about the skewness of the distribution associated with physical activity?

## Analysis of Daily Steps Taken

On this slide, provide the standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and range associated with the number of steps taken.

Standout suggestion: Provide any other measures of spread you think might be helpful to understand the dataset.

## Distribution of Heart Rates

On this slide, include a plot (graph) of the distribution of heart rates. What is the shape of the distribution? Are there any outliers?
