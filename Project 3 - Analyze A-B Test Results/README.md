## Project Scenario

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 
It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

## Starter Files

Your goal is to work through the provided Jupyter Notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new (treatment) page, keep the old (control) page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. You will also be provided with a CSV file containing the dataset. You will use the data and the Jupyter Notebook to complete the analysis.

Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track. Although the quizzes are not required to complete the project, you can use them to check your work and ensure you are on the right path. Each quiz page will show you the same notebook.

Once you have completed the notebook, you will present your results using a presentation template. There are many placeholders in the template that must be replaced with results you obtain from the analysis. You must submit both the notebook and the presentation for this project.
