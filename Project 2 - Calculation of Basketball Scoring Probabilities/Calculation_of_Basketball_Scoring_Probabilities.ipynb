    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA Player Shot dataset contains information about shots taken during the 2022-2023 basketball season \n",
    "by LeBron James, James Harden, and Steph Curry. This project will specifically be analyzing the statistics \n",
    "for Steph Curry.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Dataset Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "top: The vertical position on the court where the shot was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "left: The horizontal position on the court where the shot was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "date: The date when the shot was taken. (e.g., Oct 18, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "qtr: The quarter in which the shot was attempted, typically represented as \"1st Qtr,\" \"2nd Qtr,\" etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "time_remaining: The time remaining in the quarter when the shot was attempted, typically displayed as minutes and seconds (e.g., 09:26).\n",
    "\n",
    "result: Indicates whether the shot was successful, with \"TRUE\" for a made shot and \"FALSE\" for a missed shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "shot_type: Describes the type of shot attempted, such as a \"2\" for a two-point shot or \"3\" for a three-point shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "distance_ft: The distance in feet from the hoop to where the shot was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "lead: Indicates whether the team was leading when the shot was attempted, with \"TRUE\" for a lead and \"FALSE\" for no lead.\n",
    "\n",
    "player_team_score: Steph Curry's team's score (in points) when the shot was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "opponent_team_score: The opposing team's score (in points) when the shot was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "opponent: The abbreviation for the opposing team (e.g., LAL for Los Angeles Lakers).\n",
    "\n",
    "team: The abbreviation for Steph Curry's team (e.g., GSW for Golden State Warriors).\n",
    "\n",
    "season: The season in which the shots were taken, indicated as the year (e.g., 2023).\n",

    "On this slide, calculate and report the:\n",

    "- Overall probability of a make (result = TRUE)\n",
    "- Overall probability of a miss (result = FALSE)\n",
    "- Overall proportion of three-pointers (shot_type = 3)\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the results you found on the previous slide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of Steph making 3 of the next 4 shots?\n",
    "- What is the probability that 4 of the next 5 shots are three-pointers?\n",
    "- Also, Give the assumptions associated with the Binomial Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Probabilities - Future\n",
    "\n",
    "On this slide, use previously calculated probabilities to calculate and report the following conditional probabilities, which will require Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the next shot Steph shoots is a three-pointer...\n",
    "    - What is the probability he makes it?\n",
    "    - What is the probability it was taken while his team had the lead (lead = True)?\n",
    "- If the next shot Steph shoots is a two-pointer...\n",
    "    - What is the probability he makes it?\n",
    "    - What is the probability it was taken while his team had the lead (lead = True)?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Probabilities - Past\n",
    "\n",
    "On this slide, calculate the following conditional probabilities. If Steph just made a shot...\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability that it was a three-pointer?\n",
    "- What is the probability that it was a two-pointer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For these retrospective (past-conditional) probabilities, one could obtain the answers by direct counting, but compute them using Bayes' theorem and show your steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: First map each verbal description to notation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"made three-pointer\": P(Made,3)\n",
    "- \"three-pointer given a make\": P(3∣Made)\n",
    "- \"make\": P(Made)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once labeled, it’s clear which terms to plug into Bayes' theorem.\n",
